# T-Shirt Size Management Update

## What's New in This Version

### âœ¨ **Individual T-Shirt Size Management**

The inventory management system now displays and manages each T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL) as separate stock items, exactly as requested.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Improvements**

1. **Dashboard Display**
   - Each T-shirt size now has its own card showing distributed quantities
   - Clear visibility of S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL distributions separately
   - Professional layout with individual T-shirt icons for each size

2. **Stock Management**
   - Individual T-shirt sizes appear as separate items in stock management
   - Each size can be updated independently
   - Stock levels are tracked per size (S: 100, M: 100, L: 100, etc.)

3. **Employee Management**
   - When adding/updating employees, T-shirt sizes are handled individually
   - Stock deduction happens per specific size selected
   - Example: If employee gets M size T-shirt, only M size stock decreases

4. **Database Structure**
   - T-shirt sizes stored as separate stock items: `tshirt_s`, `tshirt_m`, `tshirt_l`, etc.
   - Employee records track quantities for each T-shirt size separately
   - Proper stock tracking and low stock alerts per size

### ðŸ“Š **How It Works**

**Dashboard View:**
- Shows "T-shirt S Distributed: 0", "T-shirt M Distributed: 0", etc.
- Each size has its own statistics card
- Clear visual separation of all T-shirt sizes

**Stock Management:**
- Lists all T-shirt sizes as individual items
- "T-shirt S: 100", "T-shirt M: 100", "T-shirt L: 100", etc.
- Each size has its own "Update" button for stock management

**Employee Operations:**
- When Bansari gets an M size T-shirt, only M size stock decreases
- When updating employees, specific T-shirt sizes are tracked
- Quantity controls work per individual T-shirt size

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

- **Backend**: Updated Stock model to include individual T-shirt size items
- **Database**: Separate entries for each T-shirt size in stock table
- **Frontend**: Modified dashboard and stock display to show individual sizes
- **API**: Updated endpoints to handle T-shirt sizes as distinct items

### ðŸš€ **Usage**

1. **View Stock**: Go to Stock Management to see all T-shirt sizes listed separately
2. **Update Stock**: Click "Update" on any specific T-shirt size to modify its quantity
3. **Employee Management**: T-shirt size selection affects only that specific size's stock
4. **Dashboard**: Monitor distribution of each T-shirt size individually

This update provides the exact functionality you requested - individual T-shirt size management throughout the entire system, from dashboard display to stock management to employee operations.

All T-shirt sizes (S/M/L/XL/XXL/XXXL) are now treated as separate inventory items, just like bags, pens, diaries, and bottles.
